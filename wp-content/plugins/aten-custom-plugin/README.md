# Aten Custom Plugin

This plugin is a template for adding custom functionality to a WordPress site through a custom plugin. 

## Development

To use this plugin template in a project, follow these steps. 

1. Rename the plugin with a human-readable name that describes the plugin's purpose (e.g. "Aten Event Calendar"). 
2. Update all references and file paths as necessary to relfect the new plugin name, keeping custom functions within separate `inc` files for clarity. 
3. Update this README to describe the custom plugin's purpose, usage, and any details that future developers and authors should know about the plugin.
